# Northcoders Learners Frontend

This is a frontend app for use with my final group project for Northcoders bootcamp - please see [THIS REPO](https://github.com/1point21/nc-ce-final-project-env).

**NOTE**: This repo was provided for our final group project by Northcoders. All code was written, except for the `Jenkinsfile`, which our team added for the CI/CD pipelines. Changes were made to environment files and `Dockerfile` as required for build and testing.

The following README was provided for us by Northcoders.


This is the frontend for adding/editing/deleting learners from our system. 

## Running the app

### Running with Docker

The application can be run with Docker by firstly building the images

```
docker build -t learners-frontend .
```

And then running the container

```
docker run -p 80:80 learners-frontend
```

Then you should be able to visit:
